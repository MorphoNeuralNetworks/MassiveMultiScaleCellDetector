# MassiveMultiScaleCellDetector_Arias
## Description
MassiveMultiScaleCellDetector (MMSCD) is a tool adapted to efficiently extract anatomical features from large brain images on the order of Terabytes. The MMSCD enables parallel computations to efficently extract, by now, the **location**, **orientation** and **size** of labeled cells from mouse whole brain images (tested in CLARITY + LSFM).

Currently, the tools is in beta version (the code requires to be revised, updated and cleaned for readability and usability).

### Performance of the Algorithm
The MMSCD is able to classify **somatic cell detections** from **blob-like detections** (e.g., blood bessels, neurites or noise artifacts)

### Grafical User Interface (GUI)
The MMSCD comes with a **user-friendly-GUI** that makes it easier both the selection of computing parameters and the visualization of the results, in an interactive way.
